	<remote  name="aponlab" fetch="https://github.com/Apon77lab" />
	#Means we can call https://github.com/Apon77lab with the name aponlab

	<remove-project name="platform_frameworks_base" />
        #Frameworks base
	#I am syncing AospExtended now, We want to remove existing AospExtended rom's platform_frameworks_base repository, in their manifest the project name is written https://github.com/AospExtended/manifest/blob/df6aca4713a81d2debee951844c49c6f061c0b40/snippets/aex.xml#L30
	so we want to remove this project name, remove-project name="platform_frameworks_base" means we want to remove their existing platform_frameworks_base repository, we got name from here https://github.com/AospExtended/manifest/blob/df6aca4713a81d2debee951844c49c6f061c0b40/snippets/aex.xml#L30
	So, it is equivalent to rm -rf frameworks/base
	Note that, project path and project name is different. path means where to clone in our computer, name means which repo to clone.

	<project path="frameworks/base" name="platform_frameworks_base" remote="aponlab" revision="auto"/>

	#project path="frameworks/base" means the folder where to sync repo,
	remote="aponlab" means we are indicating 3rd line(https://github.com/Apon77lab)
	name="platform_frameworks_base" means the repo name from the remote aponlab (i.e. https://github.com/Apon77lab/platform_frameworks_base)
	revision="auto" means the branch to clone from remote named aponlab
	So, it is equivalent to git clone https://github.com/Apon77lab/platform_frameworks/base -b auto frameworks/base
	So, ultimately we got like this, rm -rf frameworks/base && git clone https://github.com/Apon77lab/platform_frameworks/base -b auto frameworks/base
	The benefit is it will directly sync frameworks/base from aponlab remote, without cloning frameworks/base from AospExtended source first, which saves time and bandwidth

	<remove-project name="platform_frameworks_opt_telephony" />
	<project path="frameworks/opt/telephony" name="platform_frameworks_opt_telephony" remote="aponlab" revision="auto"/>
        #Telephony
	Same things goes for this line, we can do as much as we need, we can just only remove things too if needed
